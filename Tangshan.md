In surveillance footage, three women are shown sharing a meal in a barbeque restaurant when a man approaches their table and places his hand on the back of one of the women.  
As she pushes away his hand, the man slaps her and pushes her to the ground as she struggles to fend him off.

the assault is so savage  
Immediately I was filled with outrage and horror. I could totally empathize with her  
The shock and anger reverberated widely as the video spread like wildfire on Chinese social media.  
ignited a nationwide uproar  
Many were appalled that a woman was so brutally beaten simply because she rejected a man's sexual harassment.  
Others lashed out at the police for failing to take action until the incident went viral.

The attack also rekindled debate about violence against women and gender inequality in China, which critics contend remains a highly patriarchal society with pervasive misogyny despite growing awareness of gender issues among young women.  
What happened at the Tangshan barbecue restaurant was not an isolated social incident, but part of systemic gender violence.  
We need to acknowledge that we still live in an environment that supports, encourages, and drives men to engage in gender-based violence against women

we should take legal action to punish individual attackers and perpetrators.  
But without addressing systemic gender oppression, without changing the social norms that promote machismo and encourage violence, we're just going to continue our anger in the next incident  
But such discussions did not appear to sit well with the Chinese government, which has long cracked down on China's feminist movement by arresting and silencing activists and censoring online debates.

Some state media reports initially downplayed the man's act of sexual harassment as "trying to strike up a conversation," drawing backlash from female readers.  
Authorities and state media have sought to portray the attack as an isolated event, shifting the focus away from gender issues to local gang violence.  
Five of the suspects had criminal records, ranging from offenses of illegal detainment to intentional harming of others.

to eliminate systematic gender violence, China should start with incorporating more content about gender equality in education.  
t is not only about teaching kids slogans and abstract concepts, but showing them how to apply them in real life -- such as showing mutual respect for one another,  
Law enforcement should also shed its passivity when it comes to dealing with cases involving gender violence  
In many domestic violence cases, the police response was often perfunctory, while a large number of sexual assault cases were easily dismissed on the ground that there was not enough evidence  
The relatively light punishment for gender violence has also failed to deter transgressors.   
No further charges were brought.  
"Chinese women have long suffered from victim shaming in gender violence, but the girls who were assaulted in Tangshan are 'perfect' victims. They did not go out alone and they were not scantily clad," she said, referring to accusations that are often leveled at victims of sexual assault in China.  
But even though they did everything right, they were still subjected to such brutal violence -- that's what scares many of us.
